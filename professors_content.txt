David Arditi | David Arditi Professor Emeritus of Civil and Architectural Engineering Tags: Faculty Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering Industrial Technology and Management Armour College of Engineering Home Office and Department Directory Directory David Arditi Education Ph.D., Civil Engineering (Construction Management); Loughborough University, UK, 1973 M.S., Civil Engineering (Construction Engineering); Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, 1968 B.S., Civil Engineering; Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, 1967 Research Interests Description of Current Research A method is developed to measure progress in different activities automatically by using laser scanning technology. The system is able to automatically generate interim schedules based on percent complete information obtained automatically from the new tool. This study looks at the bidding process from the point of view of the construction owner. It detects unbalanced bids as well as collusive bids by using rigorous statistical analysis. A visual scheduling and progress management system is developed by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) that allows the manager to view progress simultaneously on the CPM network (or its bar chart representation) and the 3D drawings of the project, and that allows the manager to make informed managerial decisions. Advanced linear scheduling systems are developed (ALISS and RUSS). Different objective functions are used to optimize resource leveling in line-of-balance diagrams. The factors that affect the selection of the most appropriate delay analysis method are investigated. A contemporaneous delay analysis method is developed to allow parties to resolve delay claims in a way that is agreeable to all parties involved. Different prediction models including statistical analysis, artificial neural networks, case-based reasoning, boosted decision trees, and a rule-based classification system using ant colony optimization are used to predict the outcome of construction claims. A powerful hybrid decision model is developed (Universal Prediction Model) to predict the decisions of the courts in construction litigation. The electronic retrieval of information (text analytics) from court records is explored. This information provides data for the prediction models mentioned in Item (8). The possibilities of using Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are explored to build and operate large and expensive infrastructure projects in the US. The optimum combination of materials that provides maximum sustainability at minimum cost is obtained by using genetic optimization. The adoption of LEED criteria is investigated in developing countries relative to local codes, standards, regulations, and technical knowhow. An optimal material selection process is developed to support design decisions for LEED certification. A formal post-mortem analysis is promoted that leads to a “lessons learned database” of construction management issues for use in future projects. A Google-docs-based “best practices” system is developed to acquire, store and disseminate information necessary for sustainability-related decisions. A time-series-based model is developed to measure organizational flexibility that allows construction companies to expand and retract in reaction to periodic peaks and slumps in construction activity. The level of learning on the part of construction workers is investigated in safety training sessions. Worker safety issues are evaluated in nighttime highway construction and maintenance. The impact of organizational learning is investigated in the context of the design firm. The impact of the European Union enlargement on the European construction industry is investigated. The link between company culture relative to scheduling activities vs. construction delays is investigated in the US and India. The factors that motivate construction project managers are investigated; construction project managers’ human values are assessed; the motivation/values linkage is researched. The performance of minority based small and medium enterprises in construction is measured and compared with the performance of non-minority companies. The performance of international joint ventures is assessed by using structural equation modeling. The managerial competencies of female and male construction managers are measured and compared. The planning of the design, construction and brand-related activities is researched for hospitality projects. The risk of construction company default is researched and a model is developed to predict serious decline than can lead to failure. The critical issues in subcontracting are identified and feasible solutions are recommended. The marketing practices of construction companies are critically reviewed. The rate of innovation in construction management is analyzed and its effects on the construction activity are assessed. A model is developed that allows construction executives to make informed decisions concerning the short-term and long-term expansion policy of a company to international markets. The effectiveness of an internal pre-tender project peer review is investigated by means of an industry wide study. A comparative study is conducted that investigates the expectations of the different parties relative to construction management services, and that tries to reconcile the differences. A simulation model is used to prove that total project cost is minimized if supply chain buffers are not minimized under special circumstances such as fluctuating cash flows, inflation, and various discount schemes. Different prediction tools such as artificial neural networks, case based reasoning, and boosted decision trees are used to predict the cost estimate of low-rise reinforced concrete structures at the early stages of design. Different innovation diffusion models are used to explain the speed with which CAD technologies spread in the construction industry. The impact of BIM on construction management practices is researched and an up-to-date syllabus is developed to teach how to manage projects designed by BIM.

A team of researchers from the Electrochemical Energy Materials and Devices Laboratory at Illinois Institute of Technology, led by chemical engineering professor Mohammad Asadi, have now developed a new catalyst material to target the production of C3 products — using only CO2, water and electricity as inputs — by optimizing the proton-electron transport reaction to ensure there was not excessive production of co-reactants and byproducts. September 28, 2023 Illinois Tech Scientists Make Breakthrough Turning Air Pollution Into Resource for Human Use The Cool Down Mohammad Asadi, assistant professor of chemical engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology, who spearheaded the research, said: “Making renewable chemical manufacturing is really important. It’s the best way to close the carbon cycle without losing chemicals we currently use daily.” September 07, 2023 Mohammad Asadi: Lithium-Air Technology the Best Option for the Next Generation of EV Batteries HERE360 “It can improve energy density really significantly,” said Mohammad Asadi, Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, who’s partnered with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory to look into advanced battery technology.

Dr. Ashton is a sustainable systems scientist, whose research, teaching and practice are oriented around transitioning our socio-ecological systems towards sustainability and equity. She studies the adoption of socially and environmentally responsible strategies in business, and the role of innovation and entrepreneurship in addressing social and environmental challenges. Her research is grounded in industrial ecology and the circular economy. Her current work focuses on increasing sustainability and equity in urban food systems, and developing regenerative economies in post-industrial regions, newly industrializing countries and small island states. Between 2012 and 2015, she led the U.S. State Department funded Pathways to Cleaner Production in the Americas project. The project was an eight-country, interdisciplinary industry-academia partnership focused on education for cleaner production (CP) and its implementation in small and medium enterprises in Latin America. In 2018, she was awarded a Jefferson Science Fellowship through the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and spent the 2018-19 academic year at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

It means we need incentives both for households as well as for commercial institutions.” September 20, 2023 Sustainability Professor Weslynne Ashton Explains How Businesses and Technology Innovators Can Help Reduce Food Waste MarketScale “If we think about the whole supply chain, right, and where food gets wasted, it starts at the farm, happens during distribution, at retail, in the stores, in the food service, and also in households,” said Weslynne Ashton, professor of environmental management and sustainability at the Illinois Institute of Technology. “So, if we think about that entire supply chain, we can think about the new technologies that are available now around predictive analytics that can help with inventory management for ordering food. Companies can have a better handle on how much they need to order, the time frame, and what customers are most likely to purchase, using that data to better manage their inventory.” December 07, 2022 Associate Professor Weslynne Ashton Explores How to Bridge Gap between Small Food Producers, Large Institutional Buyers Inside Climate News “Large public institutions have huge spending power, and with their spending power around food, are really able to shift how food procurement happens,” said Weslynne Ashton, associate professor of environmental management at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

Her nine years of practical legal experience supplement her rigorous academic career, in which she has published and presented extensively on the topics of legal history, women in the legal profession, and feminist legal theory.  She has also provided expert commentary on numerous radio and television programs. Her book, Women and Justice for the Poor: A History of Legal Aid, 1863–1945 (Cambridge University Press, 2015), which won the prestigious 2016 Hurst Award for the best book in socio-legal history, explores the history of the development of legal aid in the United States and the significant and unknown role that women played as both providers and clients of legal aid. Her most recent edited book, Histories of Legal Aid: A Transnational and Comparative Perspective (Palgrave Macmillan, 2021) explores the history of the development of access to justice in nine different countries. After graduating summa cum laude in history from Smith College, Professor Batlan received her J.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where she served as executive editor for the Harvard Women's Law Journal . She clerked for the Honorable Constance Baker Motley of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and then worked as a law firm associate specializing in securities law and financial markets.  She then joined Greenwich NatWest as associate general counsel and head of global compliance. Eventually she returned to the academic world, completing a Ph.D. in U.S. history from New York University. Since coming to Chicago-Kent from Tulane Law School in 2006, Professor Batlan has immersed herself in a wide variety of subjects spanning law, history, financial regulation, and the humanities, serving as both director of the Institute for Compliance and co-director of the Institute for Law and the Humanities. Her teaching areas include U.S. legal history, gender and the law, feminist jurisprudence, corporations, business organizations, securities regulation, and contracts. She has taught courses internationally in Sienna, Paris, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and Bangkok. She received Chicago-Kent's Excellence in Teaching Award and IIT's Julia Beveridge Award for service to women students.

Daniel Bliss | Daniel Bliss Associate Professor of Political Science Undergraduate Program Director Tags: Faculty Social Sciences Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Daniel Bliss Daniel Bliss was appointed assistant professor of political science at Illinois Tech in 2011. His Ph.D. research examined economic development and community governance in the setting of small Midwestern towns whose financial status and prosperity have been placed under heavy stress due to the trends associated with globalization and international competition. The research focused on the ways in which communities can help themselves at modest cost to local taxpayers, both through improvements to internal governance, policy delivery and inter-local cooperation, and through financial and institutional resources provided by state government in situations where they are available. Before Illinois Tech and the completion of his Ph.D. studies, Bliss did applied research on financial planning and IT implementation for the Government Finance Officers Association, and as editor of the award winning Timberjay newspapers in Minnesota, covered state and local government and economic development and led the newsroom to statewide awards in 2001 and 2002.

Britt Burton-Freeman | Britt Burton-Freeman Professor, Food Science and Nutrition Chair, Department of Food Science and Nutrition Director, Center for Nutrition Research Tags: Faculty Media Expert Food Science and Nutrition Lewis College of Science and Letters Center for Sports Innovation Home Office and Department Directory Directory Britt Burton-Freeman Education Ph.D., University of California-Davis M.S., University of California-Davis B.S., California State University-Chico Research Interests Cardio-metabolic risk and obesity promoted by modern day eating patterns and protected by plant foods delivering select bioactive phytochemical components, such as flavonoids, fibers, and fats is a main focus of my lab. Recently, my lab’s work has focused on the reciprocal interactions of the gut metagenome with host genome in response to dietary input, including dose/time response effects of foods/bioactive components, the metabolites generated and their kinetic behavior relevant to mechanisms of action and associated health status. Work in energy intake regulation emphasizes understanding properties of fibers, and their interaction with other macronutrients, in varied food matrices to alter neuro-endocrine pathways that impact appetite and food intake behavior. My research approach exemplifies the multi-disciplinary nature of nutritional science integrating aspects of nutrition, food science, food chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology/-kinetics, and behavioral sciences to characterize and understand physiological responses to diet and dietary components in humans during normal, stressed, and pathophysiological states.

Patrick Corrigan | Patrick Corrigan Distinguished Professor of Psychology Tags: Faculty Media Expert Psychology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Patrick Corrigan Patrick Corrigan is Distinguished Professor of Psychology, director of the Center for Health Equity, Education, and Research and core faculty member in the Division of Counseling and Rehabilitation Science. Realizing that the benefits of psychiatric services are limited by stigma, he has spent the past two decades broadening his research to the prejudice and discrimination of mental illness. His work has been supported by the National Consortium on Stigma and Empowerment , a collaboration of investigators and advocates from more than a dozen institutions, where he is currently the principal investigator. Corrigan also extended his research to mental health and social determinants (e.g., ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and age) and corresponding social disadvantage related to poverty, criminal justice involvement, and immigration concerns resulting in the Chicago Health Disparities Center. He also heads projects examining integrated primary and behavioral health care in a health disparities framework. Corrigan’s group has launched an IIT training program yielding the recovery support specialist certificate for Illinois Tech students. This has led CHEER to have national expertise in the role of formal peer support workers in the mental health system.  All of Corrigan and CHEER’s work is governed by community-based participatory research (CBPR).CHEER also serves asCBPR lead trainers for the Institute for Translational Medicine . He has written more than 500 peer-reviewed articles (h index=143), is editor emeritus of the American Journal of Psychiatric Rehabilitation, and editor of Stigma and Health published by the American Psychological Association . Corrigan has authored or edited twenty books including, most recently, The Stigma Effect through Columbia University Press.  He is also part of the team that developed the Honest, Open, Proud series of anti-stigma programs. Corrigan was the 2022 recipient of the American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest.

Raj Echambadi | Raj Echambadi President, Illinois Institute of Technology Tags: Staff Office of the President Home Office and Department Directory Directory Raj Echambadi Raj Echambadi became the 10th president of Illinois Institute of Technology in August 2021. Central to Echambadi’s vision for Illinois Tech’s future is a new path to preeminence driven by four principles: first, honoring and strengthening the university’s role as an engine of opportunity and national leader in economic mobility; second, pursuing growth through reimagining education to serve learners at all stages of life; third, fueling future innovation by empowering students ; and fourth, exemplifying purpose-driven citizenship in service of Bronzeville, Chicago, and the world. From 2017 to 2021 Echambadi served as the Dunton Family Dean of D’Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University. Under his leadership, D’Amore-McKim has become widely recognized for moving beyond traditional business silos and for embracing cross-disciplinary perspectives in both research and teaching. Programmatic innovations include the “MBA x” program, “MS x” program, combined undergraduate majors, and work-integrated degrees with business partners; each of these help students and learners develop multidisciplinary perspectives by blending their business studies with non-business areas of expertise, such as computer science or experiential design. During his tenure, Echambadi created an Office of Student Engagement, Affinity, and Inclusion at D’Amore-McKim to foster better on-campus experiences for students and launched several programs—Building Belonging Fellows, Pathfinders, Peer Affinity Cohorts—in order to build an inclusive community and cultivate a culture of belonging at the school. Prior to joining Northeastern in August 2017, Echambadi served for eight years in various roles, including as the Alan J. and Joyce D. Baltz Professor and the senior associate dean of strategic innovation, at Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Echambadi was a driving force behind the scaled online M.B.A. (iMBA) program at the University of Illinois, which has been lauded as one of the best breakthrough, disruptive educational innovations in the past decade. Echambadi received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Anna University in India and a doctorate in marketing from the University of Houston. His academic research focuses on strategic innovation within organizations and how firms should balance current and future opportunities. He has won numerous teaching and research accolades including the prestigious Academy of Management Journal Best Paper Award for his work on employee entrepreneurship.

This is a very small step for us, but hopefully, it will be a giant leap for Chicago.” July 24, 2023 Illinois Tech President Raj Echambadi Addresses Bike Tour Commemorating 1919 Race Riot Streets Blog Chicago "I'm so honored to welcome you all today to our campus in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood that is so rich in historical significance and cultural legacy," said Illinois Tech president Raj Echambadi before the ride took off. "Today we are gathered to remember the tragic events that took place in 1919 – part of our shared history of the city of Chicago. We are here today not only to remember and witness the lives so tragically taken but also to ensure that we never, ever, ever forget. And indeed, we commit to eternally combat the system of prejudice and discrimination that fueled that horrific event." Learn more...

Sameh Elsaidi | Sameh Elsaidi Assistant Professor of Chemistry Tags: Faculty Chemistry Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Sameh Elsaidi Education B.S. Chemistry, Alexandria University M.S. Chemistry, Alexandria University Ph.D. Chemistry, University of South Florida Research Interests Elsaidi laboratory, the Center of Separation Science and Sustainability (CSSS), conducts research that is highly interdisciplinary in nature but focuses on the rational design, synthesis, and characterization of functional porous materials, advanced composites, and multicomponent membranes. We aim to uncover and provide fundamental insights into structure-property-function relationships of materials and to exploit applications in gas separation, gas storage, environment, energy, nuclear waste management and extraction and recovery of valuable elements. Functional porous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have revolutionized the field of materials science. Their “made-to-order” design leads to potentially limitless applications determined by their pore size, geometry, and chemical functionality. The appeal of these materials stems from the fact that MOFs are programmable and that you can control their design to behave exactly as you want it to. This is because the number of components available to build new MOFs (metal salts and organic ligands) is nearly unlimited. Their numbers have skyrocketed, as has the realization that these highly porous materials have enormous commercial potential, with applications ranging from separations to biological science. Alongside, composite materials and membranes are used to tackle the need for bulk performance or properties that cannot be accomplished using a single component. The use of several components in the composite/membrane fabrication can engender the same material with several properties at once, such as excellent mechanical properties, high permeability/adsorption capacity, superb selectivity, chemical/physical/thermal/radiation stability, etc. The high degree of control over the properties of composite materials/membranes makes them promising candidates that can make significant advances in the field of separation science and sustainability. Elsaidi group will aim to develop novel porous materials, composites and membranes that exhibit cost-reduction, eco-friendly practices, radical improvements in performance over existing state-of-the-art materials, and potentially revolutionizing the current technologies specifically in (1) Radioactive waste management; (2) Nuclear Forensic; (3) Radiation-Resistant Materials; (4) Extraction of rare earth elements, (5) Uranium extraction, (6) Coatings, (7) Global warming, and (8) Production of synthetic fuels, and generally in (1) Separation science, (2) Environmental applications, (3) Sustainable energy, (4) Heterogeneous catalysis, and (5) Materials manufacturing. Our research spans almost all the conventional disciplines of organic, inorganic, analytical and physical chemistry, and chemical and materials engineering, providing a very eclectic blend of ideas, techniques, and strategies.

Alexander Flueck | Alexander Flueck Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Tags: Faculty Electrical and Computer Engineering Armour College of Engineering Home Office and Department Directory Directory Alexander Flueck Education Ph.D., Cornell University, 1996 M.Eng., EE, Cornell University, 1992 B.S., EE, Cornell University, 1991 Research Interests Alexander Flueck joined the Illinois Tech faculty in August of 1996. His research interests focus on power system stability and control. He is currently developing robust and efficient computational tools that will assist power engineers in planning and operating large-scale electric power systems, while emphasizing security and competitiveness. The goal of Flueck's research is to numerically compute the safe operating region of electric power systems under varying load/generation levels and facility outage contingencies. Determining the safe operating region of a large-scale power system is computationally demanding, thereby requiring extensive research in numerical methods. Flueck's teaching interests concentrate on challenging students with hands-on problem solving. Based on his teaching experience, he believes that students only master those skills that they can apply to concrete examples. Therefore, students can expect homework assignments to be heavy on the mental gymnastics. Likewise, the in-depth lab experiments are designed to reinforce the basic fundamentals in electrical and computer engineering.

Conversations about AI date back to the 1940s, but the launch of ChatGPT last year began a new era. “You can really do lots of different things with this AI,” Fortnow says. February 01, 2023 College of Computing Dean Lance Fortnow Hails Professor Who Pioneered Smoothed Analysis in Solving Simplex Conundrum Communications of the ACM Daniel Spielman has a great ability “to come up with new approaches,” said Lance Fortnow, dean of the College of Computing at Illinois Institute of Technology. “It wasn’t like someone else had invented smoothed analysis and Spielman said, ‘Let’s try it on linear programming.’ This was, ‘I want to understand linear programming. What's the right way to do it?’” October 28, 2022 Illinois Tech Engages Computer Science Students by Bringing Tech Workers into the Classroom NPR “We’re teaching you these concepts, but you don’t see the connection between the concepts and how it’s going to play out in the world,” said Lance Fortnow, dean of the College of Computing to NPR's Marketplace. “This idea of bringing companies in early … then as you’re learning, you can see, ‘Oh, I see how maybe I can apply this idea to what the company is doing.'” Learn more...

Students Clients Seeking Legal Services Jamie Franklin Associate Clinical Professor Clinical Faculty Full-Time Faculty Faculty and Scholarship Faculty Directory Jamie Franklin Jamie Franklin joined the Chicago-Kent College of Law faculty in August 2020 as supervising attorney of the C-K Law Group’s Civil Litigation Clinic. Her practice areas include employment discrimination and retaliation, wage and hour law, qui tam (False Claims Act) litigation, class actions, and other complex litigation on behalf of plaintiffs. She also teaches employment-related classes at the Law School. More information about her clinic’s cases can be found at the Civil Litigation Clinic’s website . From 2011 to 2020, Professor Franklin owned and operated the Franklin Law Firm in Chicago, where she litigated extensively in federal and state courts nationwide on behalf of plaintiffs in the areas of employment discrimination, class actions, wage and hour law, employee benefits, consumer law, qui tam (False Claims Act) and whistleblower litigation, oil and gas royalties, and historic preservation law. Her goal was to provide the highest level of legal representation to those who were historically outmaneuvered in the legal arena. She also successfully resolved many employment disputes in mediation and arbitration and handled numerous appeals. Before starting her own firm, Professor Franklin was a partner and an associate at Meites, Mulder, Mollica & Glink, a plaintiff-side firm in Chicago that specialized in employment matters, class actions, and consumer law. There, she practiced in federal courts throughout the country, seeking to bring cases that served two goals: to help the employee or plaintiff in need and to have a broader impact on an area of the law affecting plaintiffs. Prior to that, she practiced consumer law at Edelman Combs Latturner & Goodwin. Professor Franklin’s interest in plaintiff’s law extended to law school, where she was awarded a Consumer Law Fellowship while attending the University of Chicago Law School that enabled her to represent consumers at the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago. Professor Franklin is a member of the Illinois State Bar and the federal Trial Bar, and she is admitted to numerous federal circuit and district courts. She is rated as AV Preeminent by Martindale-Hubbell and was selected as an Illinois Super Lawyer each year from 2017 until she joined Chicago-Kent's faculty.

Their name is on the court case. That’s going to be something that’s going to be with them for life,” Chicago-Kent assistant clinical professor Jamie Franklin said. WTTW November 14, 2022 Chicago-Kent Professor Jamie Franklin Describes Barriers Workers Face in Banding Together in Lawsuits “There are very few workers who want to stick their necks out and be named plaintiffs in class action lawsuits. Their name is on the court case. That’s going to be something that’s going to be with them for life,” Chicago-Kent law professor Jamie Franklin said. “Even finding an attorney to represent them can be a challenge. Because these cases take so long, attorneys who take them may end up bearing years and years of risk of not being paid.” WTTW Go to the previous slide. Go to the next slide.

Alissa Haedt-Matt | Alissa Haedt-Matt Director, Clinical Training Program Associate Professor of Psychology Director of Clinical Psychology Tags: Faculty Media Expert Psychology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Alissa Haedt-Matt Dr. Haedt-Matt is an Associate Professor and core faculty member of the Clinical Psychology Program, for which she teaches graduate courses and advises Clinical Psychology PhD students. She is also a member of the Undergraduate Program and teaches a variety of undergraduate courses and supervises capstone research projects. Dr. Haedt-Matt serves on the editorial board of three journals ( Eating Behaviors , Eating Disorders: Journal of Treatment & Prevention , International Journal of Eating Disorders ) and is a member of the Eating Disorder Research Society and the Academy for Eating Disorders. She has numerous publications, has presented her research at national and international conferences, and has received grant funding for her work. Dr. Haedt-Matt is the director of the Eating Behaviors Lab at Illinois Tech. One of the most commonly cited explanations for eating pathology is that increases in negative emotions trigger maladaptive eating behaviors and that those behaviors function to alleviate negative affect. Dr. Haedt-Matt’s primary line of research focuses on this intersection of affect dysregulation and eating pathology - body dissatisfaction, binge eating and related dysregulated eating behaviors, purging, and nonpurging compensatory behaviors. Her work has contributed to the literature by using diverse methods, including correlational, experimental, and longitudinal real-time assessments, to support the validity and generalizability of study findings. Additional lines of research have, 1) used ecological momentary assessment to test other models of the etiology and maintenance of eating pathology, including psychological, physiological, interpersonal, and environmental factors, 2) contributed to the classification of eating disorders, particularly Purging Disorder, and 3) enhanced our understanding of eating disorders and body image in a number of different populations (e.g., sexual minorities, gender minorities, Black women, Latina women, male collegiate athletes, and female veterans). Current projects extend her research program to investigate the real-time social and behavioral processes associated with eating disorders and their treatment through social media data analytics.

Timothy Hobbs | Timothy Hobbs Research Assistant Professor Tags: Faculty Physics Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Timothy Hobbs Education B.A., Physics and Mathematics, The University of Chicago M.S., Physics, Indiana University Ph.D., Physics, Indiana University Research Interests My research focuses on an array of issues at the interface of particle and nuclear theory, with an emphasis on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. I am particularly interested in problems related to the nonperturbative structure of hadronic systems like the proton and pion and implications for topics ranging from nuclear structure and astrophysics to high-energy collider phenomenology, beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics searches, and neutrino scattering. This work frequently depends on a subtle interplay of QCD theory, model building, and advanced computation and statistics, with many opportunities for input from emerging AI and machine-learning technologies. I am also involved with the physics motivation and planning for the coming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), which is the next accelerator planned for construction in the United States to peer inside the inner workings of the proton and nuclei with unprecedented precision.

Behzad Imanian | Behzad Imanian Research Assistant Professor Leader of IFSH HTS Initiative Tags: Faculty Media Expert Food Science and Nutrition Home Office and Department Directory Directory Behzad Imanian Behzad Imanian worked as a computational biologist and research fellow in the Genome Sciences Center, BC Cancer Agency, Canada prior to acquiring his doctorate degree. He contributed to the quality control of sequencing of the Bovine and Spruce genome and transcriptome sequencing and the Pleiades Promoter Projects. His PhD and postdoctoral research explored the genomic consequences of a long-term endosymbiosis in dinotoms. Since March 2016, he has been leading the High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Initiative in Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute for Food Safety and Health (IFSH). The IFSH HTS laboratory he helped to establish is equipped with advanced HTS sequencers, and it offers a variety of services that include Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), metagenomics (16s rDNA and shotgun sequencing) for environmental monitoring, transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and other HTS applications. In addition to directing the HTS laboratory, Dr. Imanian has established the bioinformatics center in IFSH. The center houses four High Performance Computers (HPCs), and a large data storage and backup system. The IFSH bioinformatics Center is capable of providing analytical services from quality control, genome and transcriptome assembly, SNP analysis, to annotation and much more to all the researchers in the IFSH, IIT, the food industry as well as outside collaborators. The center also provides direct access to the IFSH HPCs for all our collaborators who desire to conduct the analytical work on their data themselves.

Oscar Juarez | Oscar Juarez Associate Professor of Biology Tags: Faculty Media Expert Biology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Oscar Juarez Education Ph.D. National University of Mexico B.S. National University of Mexico Research Interests Our lab conducts biomedical research directed to establish the metabolic strategies and host- pathogen relationship in bacterial pathogenic species, such as Chlamydia trachomatis , the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the world, and Vibrio cholerae , which produces severe gastrointestinal disease to millions of people in developing countries. Our research uses an interdisciplinary approach to study these topics, with diverse methodologies, such as molecular and structural biology, protein chemistry and cell biology. This strategy allows us to characterize the behavior of enzymes and understand molecular and subatomic aspects, such as electron movement and conformational changes, and apply these concepts to cell to cell relationships, disease development and drug design.

Kim said updating terms is usually perfectly legal if consumers are given reasonable notice and the option to opt-out. But, she added, 23andMe will likely struggle to prove it provided both to its customers. Axios November 17, 2023 Law Professor Nancy Kim: Biden’s Executive Order on AI Is Ambitious — and Incomplete Last month President Biden issued an executive order on artificial intelligence, the government’s most ambitious attempt yet to set ground rules for this technology. The order focuses on establishing best practices and standards for AI models, seeking to constrain Silicon Valley’s propensity to release products before they’ve been fully tested — to “move fast and break things.” But despite the order’s scope — it’s 111 pages and covers a range of issues including industry standards and civil rights — two glaring omissions may undermine its promise. Los Angeles Times July 21, 2023 Chicago-Kent Professor Nancy Kim Discusses How Hidden Contracts on the Internet Came to Be "What Zeidenberg represents is a big break in contract doctrine," said contract professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. "It opened the door to the idea that, hey, there are other ways that we can enter into a contract." NPR Go to the previous slide. Go to the next slide.

Additional Info Experience Daniel Krieglstein is a Behavioral Designer and Scientist. His work involves the application of psychological principles to technology development and brand messaging. His experience spans clinical, research, teaching, administrative, and technology development. In short, he loves developing hypotheses from noisy, confusing datasets; and allowing consumer behaviors to drive design choice. Predicting the final consumer's behavior should not be an expensive guess. Daniel has held executive positions as both Director of Behavioral Design and as CEO of his own grant funded startup. He currently consults through a research and design firm (Live Neuron Labs) and a digital media company (Determined). Contracts have included the American Heart Association, Northwestern University, leading luxury auto manufactures, and a U.S. electric utility. Daniel earned his Ph.D. in Psychology from the Illinois Institute of Technology. Having completed clinical training, he resolved to turn his grant funded dissertation into a database company. This began his transition from clinician to a technologist. Since formally ending his clinical work with cancer patients, Daniel has been working with digital technologies as both a researcher and consultant for over a decade. He has been a pioneer in user-communication-as-experimentation for product development and brand messaging. This research has been presented at the annual Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies conferences, in addition to the International Society for Universal Dialogue. Daniel taught in IIT's Psychology program for eight years and in Northeastern Illinois University's Psychology program for two years. He has been teaching internet coding and behavioral design in IIT’s Information Technology and Management program since 2015. He is a board member for the International Society for Universal Dialogue. Additionally, he is a Peer Reviewer for the Journal of Clinical Psychology, a Senior Editor on Wikipedia, novice coder, and avid gamer. Contact Information kriedan@iit.edu Learn more...

Washington Post April 24, 2023 NFTs Are the Greatest Disruption to the Art World Since Cubism, Writes Law Professor Edward Lee Today, we are witnessing the greatest disruption to the art world since cubism — along with a similar backlash. Underlying this disruption is a technology called a non-fungible token, or NFT, a computer program that establishes a new type of virtual ownership not just for digital artworks but also for anything that can be owned. Chicago Tribune January 26, 2023 Professor Edward Lee Cited in Story About 'Banned Words' in Federal Court “The term ‘patent troll’ may operate as a moral panic in a way that is detrimental to reasoned analysis and consideration of the root problems related to the issue of abusive patent litigation tactics,” Lee wrote in a law review article. Given the nature of the term and the negative way it has been used in news articles, he concluded that it would be prejudicial in the context of a patent trial.

Nicole Legate | Nicole Legate Associate Professor Director of Undergraduate Programs Tags: Faculty Media Expert Psychology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Nicole Legate Nicole Legate is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology. She teaches undergraduate courses in introduction to psychology and a special topics seminar in prejudice and stigma. She received her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Rochester in 2014, and completed a pre-doctoral internship at the University Counseling Center at the University of Rochester. Her research interests are focused on how the social environment (friends, family, peers, etc.) can support those with a stigmatized identity to buffer against minority stress and its impact on health, but also how the social environment can thwart these individuals and contribute to the mental and physical health disparities gap. Much of this work has focused on the coming out process, finding that lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals are more ‘out’ with those who support their autonomy, and that they experience better mental and physical health with these people when they come out. Another major focus is on how environments can pressure people to exclude or hurt others, and the costs associated with doing that.

Weikang Ma | Weikang Ma Research Assistant Professor Tags: Faculty Biology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Weikang Ma Education Ph.D., Department of Biology, Illinois Institute of Technology, USA (2016) BSc., Department of Biotechnology, Dalian Medical University, China (2011) Research Interests I have spent a large part of my professional career studying the structural and functional properties of striated muscle using synchrotron X-ray diffraction at Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT). Synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction is the only technique for studying the nm-scale structure of actively contracting muscle preparations under physiological conditions. This position has allowed me to establish strong collaborative research programs as well as my own independent research projects. A strong focus of my own independent research projects has been on the structural (X-ray diffraction) and biochemical (ATP turnover rate) aspects of thick filament regulation in healthy and dysregulation in diseased porcine heart tissue. I collaborate with many groups with very different backgrounds and unique approaches to their specific scientific projects. My collaborative work ranges from structural and functional studies on invertebrate skeletal muscle (insects and tarantula) to transgenic animal models (mouse, rat, and porcine) for human diseases and to human biopsies sample from patients and healthy donors.

Yuanbing Mao | Yuanbing Mao Department of Chemistry Chair Professor of Chemistry Tags: Faculty Media Expert Chemistry Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Yuanbing Mao Education Ph.D. in Chemistry, State University of New York at Stony Brook M.S. in Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, CAS B.S. in Chemistry, Xiangtan University Research Interests My research centers around designing advanced nanomaterials, achieving desirable properties and functionalities, and tackling complex interdisciplinary material challenges. Current studies focus on the development of facile and reliable synthesis methods for complex metal oxide nanomaterials, the investigation of their novel properties, and the exploration of their application potentials in the areas of optoelectronics, energy conversion, and sustainability. Specifically, we are interested to: Develop and investigate metal oxide-based nanophosphors and nanoscintillators for lighting, radiation detection, and biodiagnostics, and determine their electronic structure by complementary techniques, especially X-ray spectroscopies, as a critical step in learning how to control, design, and engineer these oxides. Study and understand the underlying mechanism and parameters that govern the water splitting reduction/oxidation activities and ideally discover a convenient activity descriptor(s) of strongly correlated complex transition metal oxides, e.g. delafossite oxides CuIMIIIO2. Design and evaluate oxide-based nanostructured photocatalysts for photodegradation and antibacterial wastewater treatment, understand the fundamental adsorption and reactive species generation kinetics and mechanisms, and develop quantitative relationship between activity and underlying mechanism. In the past several years after I started my independent academic career, I have established the Multifunctionalized Applications of Oxides (MAO) research group and built a vigorous, competitive and well-funded research program with sufficient external funds (several million dollars). I have led many of my proposal development efforts and built teams to secure grant cross departments, colleges, and universities. As the Principal Investigator, I have secured grants from the National Science Foundation (both regular and MRI grants), the DoD Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA, Young Investigator Award), the DoD HBCU/MI program, the Air Force of Scientific Research (AFOSR), American Chemical Society – Petroleum Research Fund (ACS PRF), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. I have also served as co-PIs of an NSF PREM program and a DARPA project. As a professor, I believe that great mentors are those who help his/her students remove barriers in their thinking and create boundaries to work within. It is our duty to advance our students’ careers and enhance their chances of success in whatever endeavors they choose to pursue. Moreover, my mentees always matter to me on a personal level. I was honored to receive the inaugural Outstanding Mentorship Award from the CUR Chemistry Division in 2019.

Rajendra Mehta | Rajendra Mehta Professor Emeritus of Biology Tags: Faculty Biology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Rajendra Mehta Education B.S. Gujarat University Ph.D. University of Nebraska-Lincoln Research Interests The overall research goal of our laboratories is to identify new cancer chemopreventive agents and evaluate their efficacy in a variety of target organs. We have been working with in vitro and in vivo experimental models for breast, colon, lung and prostate carcinogenesis. Currently our research is focused on determining molecular mechanism of action of a relatively non-toxic analog of vitamin D in mammary and colon carcinogenesis. This analog was identified in our laboratory as a potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic analog of vitamin D and is currently being considered for clinical trials. Resveratrol, present in grapes and red wine, is another chemopreventive agent that was identified by us as an efficacious cancer chemopreventive agent. We have been studying molecular mechanism of action of resveratrol in colon and lung carcinogenesis.

Nick Menhart | Nick Menhart Deputy VP for Accreditation Tags: Faculty Biology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Nick Menhart Education B.S. University of Waterloo Ph.D. University of Waterloo Research Interests My major research interest concern the use of spectroscopic techniques to study multi-domain proteins. In many cases high resolutions structural data is available for only individual domains of proteins, while their arrangement within the context of the entire molecule is unknown. This arrangement is crucial to the function in certain cases. One of the systems currently under study, plasminogen, is such a case. This is a key enzyme in the haemostatic system, being responsible for the dissolution of blood clots. Treatments for heart attack and stroke, the first and third leading causes of mortality in affluent societies, involve activating plasminogen to its active form, plasmin. However, plasminogen normally circulates in a compact from that is not easily activated. It is known that it can adopt a more open form, for instance on the surface of a fibrin clot, that is much more readily activated. This open form - closed form transition has been studies by a wide variety of techniques, however detailed structural information has not been forthcoming, since the intact molecule is too large for current NMR instruments, and has so far been refractory to crystallization. However, plasminogen is composed of several constituent units; in addition to its protease domains (~25kDa), plasminogen contains in five other compact domains known as kringles (~10kDa). The structures of most of these domains are known in isolation by either X-ray or NMR studies, or in some cases both. We are attempting to study this transition by placing spectroscopic probes (paramagnetic or fluorescent) on the various domains of plasminogen to try to localize these specific domains and determine their proximity to each other during this transition. By combining distance measurement between these domains, solvent accessibility data for the various surfaces, with the known high resolution structures of each isolated domain, we hope be able to assemble a model of the structure of the intact molecule in each of its conformational states.

David Minh | David Minh Robert E. Frey, Jr. Endowed Chair in Chemistry Associate Professor of Chemistry Associate Director, Center for Interdisciplinary Scientific Computation (CISC) Tags: Faculty Chemistry Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory David Minh Education Ph.D. University of California, San Diego M.S. University of California, San Diego B.A. University of California, Berkeley Research Interests The research of the David Minh group is in computational chemical biology. That is, we develop and apply computational methods to characterize interactions between small molecules and biological molecules. More specifically, our current efforts are: Computational methods for faster and more accurate binding free energy calculations. Unlike fast molecular docking methods, our new methods consider entropy as well as the enthalpy of binding. We derive new theories that enable computational shortcuts to rigorous binding free energy calculations. We also develop and test computer software that implements the new theory. Techniques to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. Simulations do not need to mimic motion on an atomic scale in order to sample configurations from the proper equilibrium distribution. We are implementing and testing new types of Monte Carlo moves. Chemometric methods for integrating and analyzing measurement data from multiple sources. We are writing statistical analysis packages based on Bayesian statistics (the foundation of deep learning) to combine binding-related data from multiple measurements and instruments. The programs will also propose new experiments that maximize information gain. Application of molecular modeling to biomedical problems. In collaboration with Oscar Juarez from the biology department, we are currently focusing on modeling metabolic enzymes from pathogenic bacteria. We are studying redox-induced conformational changes and the binding of metabolites and inhibitors. We plan to screen for and optimize new inhibitors as potential antibiotics. Publications Menzer, W.

Students Clients Seeking Legal Services Greg Reilly Professor of Law, Co-Director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law, Associate Dean for Scholarship and Faculty Development Full-Time Faculty Intellectual Property Program Faculty and Scholarship Faculty Directory Greg Reilly Professor Reilly's research and teaching interests are at the intersection of intellectual property and federal courts/procedure, with a particular focus on how institutions and decision makers resolve patent disputes. His projects have focused on the fit between patent doctrines and the relevant decision makers; differences between patent examination and invalidation; patent claim construction; and the efforts of district courts to attract patent cases. Professor Reilly's work has been published in the Boston University Law Review, Southern California Law Review, Washington University Law Review , and Notre Dame Law Review . At Chicago-Kent, Professor Reilly teaches Patent Law and Civil Procedure. Prior to joining the Chicago-Kent faculty, Professor Reilly held a tenure-track appointment at California Western School of Law and was a Harry A. Bigelow Teaching Fellow and Lecturer in Law at the University of Chicago Law School. He previously spent five years as an associate in the San Diego office of Morrison & Foerster LLP, where he had extensive appellate and district court experience litigating patent, trademark, complex commercial, and products liability cases. After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, Professor Reilly clerked for Judge Timothy B. Dyk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Professor Reilly received his undergraduate degree summa cum laude from Georgetown University. Between college and law school, he taught 7th grade with Teach for America in eastern North Carolina. Aside from the law, Professor Reilly's other two passions in life are his family—his wife, Erin, and two children—and basketball, especially the Georgetown Hoyas and Chicago Bulls.

Dedicated to Fallen Journalists WTTW “It deals with what I think is a global issue, freedom of the press, not just an American issue,” Professor John Ronan said. “The role of the journalist has never been more important, and the ideals of a free press never more consequential than it is today.” August 01, 2023 Illinois Tech Architecture Professor John Ronan's Chicago Park District Headquarters Manifests Everyday Grandeur Architectural Record Illinois Institute of Technology Professor John Ronan’s formal and material choices are informed by the larger social-political project of which this building is a key part—that of bringing municipal agencies out of Chicago’s downtown and into the communities they serve, in this case the primarily Hispanic southwest neighborhood of Brighton Park. Both Ronan and the Park District’s staff understood that doing so meant more than transplanting the department’s drab, cubicle-dominated offices onto a new site. It meant creating a new neighborhood park and field house, and integrating into these public spaces a more open and accessible set of offices that would enable the roughly 200 Park District administrators to engage with the surrounding community and experience the services that the district provides on a daily basis.

Adams St., Room 753, Chicago, IL 60661 Download CV Media Appearances March 13, 2024 Chicago-Kent Law Professor Carolyn Shapiro: Bring Chicago Home Is a Legal Ballot Measure The Bring Chicago Home ballot measure just survived a legal challenge — and unless the Illinois Supreme Court orders otherwise, the question will remain on the ballot and the Chicago Board of Elections will count each vote cast on March 19. The measure itself is straightforward, if wordy. It restructures the real estate transfer tax from a flat tax to a progressive tax in order to raise funds to address homelessness. And because part of that restructuring involves increasing the transfer tax on high-priced real estate, the Illinois Municipal Code requires voter approval, which is what Bring Chicago Home is seeking. Chicago Tribune February 12, 2024 Chicago-Kent Professor Carolyn Shapiro Discusses Trump Asking Supreme Court to Put Off Election Interference Trial “There’s nowhere to go if the Supreme Court says no here,” said Carolynn Shapiro, professor of law and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law. “That’s what I think they will do, that’s what I think they should do. It’s possible they will do something different.” WTTW February 07, 2024 SCOTUS Expert Carolyn Shapiro Says Court Must Not Kick Decision on Whether Trump Can Stay on Ballot to Congress “We need a clear answer to the question of Trump’s eligibility as soon as possible,” said Carolyn Shapiro, the founder of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Institute of the Supreme Court of the United States. “The significant risks of chaos and even violence will only escalate without that certainty.” Business Insider Go to the previous slide.

Wade and federally legalize abortion nationwide. “It means that Congress would pass a law that would provide many of the same protections that the Supreme Court previously recognized as being constitutional via Roe v. Wade, whether or not that would stand up against the current Supreme Court I think is anybody’s question,” said Noah Smith-Drelich, assistant professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of Law.

Todd Springer | Todd Springer Associate Teaching Professor Tags: Faculty Lewis College of Science and Letters Physics Home Office and Department Directory Directory Todd Springer Education B.A. Carleton College (Physics) Ph.D. University of Minnesota (Physics) Research Interests I have interests both in fundamental physics and in physics education. On the physics side, I am interested in the physics of heavy-ion collisions—what happens when two heavy nuclei traveling close to the speed of light collide with each other? In such collisions, an extremely hot liquid called the quark-gluon plasma is formed; this state of matter was also the dominant form of energy in our universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang. I have worked to understand the thermodynamics and fluid-like properties of this state of matter. In addition, I spend a lot of my time thinking about pedagogy and physics education. How can our physics courses be improved to strengthen student learning? I am a firm believer in cooperative group problem solving and peer instruction, as well as the use of e-learning resources to promote deep conceptual understanding.

Jeff Terry | Jeff Terry Professor of Physics Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Tags: Faculty Media Expert Physics Lewis College of Science and Letters Armour College of Engineering Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering Social Sciences Home Office and Department Directory Directory Jeff Terry Jeff Terry is a professor in the Physics and Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering Departments at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where his main research focus is on energy systems. He has served as the Interim Chair in the Department of Social Sciences from 2020 and the Interim Chair of Biology from Jan 2023. His group works to develop new ways of dealing with radioactive waste; to understand radiation damage mechanisms in materials; and to synthesize novel materials for energy storage and conversion. Prior to joining the faculty at Illinois Tech, he was a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. There, he worked on the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), and was a member of the team that sent the first waste shipment to WIPP. He is a former scientific director of the Advanced Test Reactor National Scientific User Facility. Terry received his doctorate in chemical physics from Stanford University in 1997 after obtaining a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1990. Education B.S. University of Chicago Ph.D. Stanford University Research Interests My training is as a physical chemist with a specialization in synchrotron radiation techniques. I have extensive experience using a variety of analytical techniques to examine surface chemistry and to solve the problems of materials at surfaces. Presently, my interests lie in studying biomaterials chemistry using synchrotron radiation techniques. I have used soft X-ray techniques such photoelectron (PES), X-ray emission (SXE), and X-ray absorption spectroscopes (XAS) to determine electronic and geometric structures of many systems. These techniques are direct probes of the electronic structure of an interface and I put these techniques to use studying the chemistry of biomaterials. For example, in the case of a metalloprotein, it would be possible to determine: the oxidation state of the metal, the number of metals atoms present, and the direction of charge transfer in the molecule. Local atomic structure (bond lengths, angles, bonding sites) can also be determined using these techniques due to interference properties of the emitted photon (fluorescence holography (SXE)) or photoelectron (photoelectron diffraction (PED), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XAS)). Extracting this information from the experimental data requires the use of first principles, quantum mechanical calculations. Specifically, I would like to use these techniques to improve our understanding of the following areas: Metal interactions with bacteria, necessary for understanding bioremediation Physicochemical states of metals in diseased tissue Oxidation state and local atomic structure of metals in pharmaceuticals Local atomic structure of artificial bone materials Publications Google Scholar Profile Expertise Electronic Structure, Radiochemistry, Radiation Damage, Multilayer Structures, Synchrotron Radiation Characterization Contact Information terryj@iit.edu Website 630.252.9708 312.567.3576 166B Robert A.

Fouad Teymour | Fouad Teymour S.C. Johnson Professor of Chemical Engineering Director of the Center for Complex Systems and Dynamics Tags: Faculty Media Expert Chemical and Biological Engineering Armour College of Engineering Center for Sports Innovation Home Office and Department Directory Directory Fouad Teymour Education Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin, Madison (Chemical Engineering, 1989) M.S. from Cairo University, Egypt (Chemical Engineering, 1982) B.S. from Cairo University, Egypt (Chemical Engineering, 1979) Research Interests Professor Teymour's research interests are in the areas of polymer reaction engineering, mathematical modeling, and nonlinear dynamics. His present research activities in these areas are: Polymer Reaction Engineering and Mathematical Modeling His research in the area of polymer reaction engineering is aimed at improving polymer properties and polymerization processes through the fundamental understanding gained from the coupling of mathematical modeling and experimental validation. Professor Teymour's current research areas in this field focus on the molecular weight distribution characteristics for polymerization systems subject to long chain branching and/or crosslinking. These systems, which can result in gel formation, pose a two-faceted problem involving not only polymerization process issues, but also polymer product quality concerns. He also conducts research in the areas of interfacial polycondensation for both microencapsulation and polymer membrane production, electropolymerization fundamentals, and polymer applications in fuel cells. Nonlinear Dynamics In the area of nonlinear dynamics, Professor Teymour's research is aimed at understanding and analyzing the complex phenomena of dynamic systems behavior. This is mainly applied to chemically reacting systems from the fields of polymerization, catalysis, and biochemical and enzymatic reactions. His research is concerned with such phenomena as steady state multiplicity, limit cycle behavior, deterministic chaotic behavior, and complex oscillations.

Expertise I have expertise in bioconjugate chemistry, molecular imaging, nano/micro-fabrication, cell biology and material engineering. My research focuses on developing novel methods, materials and devices for detection and intervention of bioprocesses. Students receive training in biochemistry, biophysics, analytical chemistry, surface chemistry, composite materials and cell biology through the following on-going research projects: Examination of structure-function relationship for collagen in native tissues. Collagen is the most abundant structural protein in connective tissues. Defects in collagen fiber and fiber network were frequently linked to health conditions, aging and diseases. Aiming to reveal the correlations of collagen’s biochemical, biophysical and biomechanical features with patients’ clinical conditions, my group has carried out studies of collagen on the nanoscopic to macroscopic scales in pelvic floor connective tissues harvested from patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) (via collaborations with surgeons in Rush and NorthShore hospitals). The work opens up the opportunity of assessing collagen functionality via a clinical test during a patient’s visit. It allows clinicians to alert any pre-symptomatic conditions, to employ peculiar treatment for preventing further development of the condition, and to reduce unneeded invasive surgical procedures. Examination of the multi-scale structure, composition and mechanics of collagen, elastin and smooth muscle cells as well as the integration/deterioration of these tissue components is under way to elucidate their association with the emergence and progression of POP. Development of biocomposite materials as tissue engineering scaffolds . The research on the structure-function relationship of collagen furnishes the design principles for tissue engineering scaffolds. Accordingly, we have developed biocomposite materials in an effort of modulating the biochemical composition and biophysical properties of cell culture matrices.  Particularly, single-walled CNT was incorporated in collagen, spider silk or silkworm silk protein to generate biocomposite fibers by electrospinning. The addition of a minute amount of CNT effectively improved protein fiber alignment, mechanical strength and electrical conductivity while retained high biocompatibility, mimicking native collagen fibers in the matrix of connective tissues. The composite fibers effectively mediated electrical stimulation of patients’ fibroblasts to boost collagen productivity. The developed approach offers a simple, direct and effective way to restore the function of patients’ cells which can be potentially used for personalized cell therapeutic treatment of diseases (e.g., chronic wound of diabetes patients) and health conditions (e.g., pelvic organ prolapse) associated with collagen disorder. Undergoing research includes the examination of these cells’ functionality in remodeling the decellularized or engineered matrices of connective tissues. This offers a simple, direct and quick assessment of the functionality of the stimulated cells, allowing timely feedback for adjusting parameters to further optimize the stimulation conditions. Histological outcome of the tissues after local injection of the stimulated cells will also be evaluated in a mouse model to establish the feasibility. Salivary sensor for label-free detection of periodontal causative oral bacteria . Periodontitis is an inflammatory disorder initiated by the accumulation of predominantly anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria in subgingival sites, which induce local and systemic inflammatory changes and promote the loss of attachment and alveolar bone. These clinical changes are associated with changes in the microbial composition of adherent plaque at or below the gingival margin. Since periodontitis often progresses without noticeable symptoms, patients are often unaware of their pathologic condition until the periodontal destruction progresses to the point of no return. A simple, rapid, direct method to detect shifts in the resident microbial species is ideal for longitudinal monitoring to provide timely assessment and is expected to improve the medical outcomes dramatically. In this project, we will apply the nanohole-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (HERS) to establish a high throughput, hyperspectral imaging approach. Coupled with machine learning, each microbial species can be identified via its signature Raman signal to achieve simultaneous detection of eight microbial species in patients’ saliva on a microfluidic chip. The sensing modality will enable label-free, rapid, reusable, potentially unlimited multiplex detection at high sensitivity and high specificity, and will facilitate the development of a portable salivary sensor device for convenient use in a dentist’s office or at home. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) will also be explored as an alternative sensing modality. IR-responsive polymer in sensor application . PolyN-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAAm) is a thermo-responsive polymer. Aqueous solutions of PNIPAAm show a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). PNIPAAm chains hydrate to form expanded structures in water when the temperature is below its LCST, but become compact structures by dehydration when heated above its LCST. The temperature-sensitive polymer has been widely studied for its application in sensing, drug delivery, filtration and as a food packaging material. My group discovered recently that incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) in PNIPAAm rendered rapid bending of the polymer in response to IR irradiation. We develop PNIPAAm-based composite materials as thermally responsive and tunable films, fibers and microgels, and explore their gating behavior in applications of disease diagnosis, treatment, as well as drug or odor compound encapsulation and release, among others.

Kacek Hall, shuttered more than a decade ago. Carman Hall remained open, but a third of its apartments were vacant, says Bruce Watts, the school’s vice president for administration. Learn more...

Wernick is the Motorola Endowed Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, and Director of Illinois Institute of Technology's Medical Imaging Research Center (MIRC). Wernick has diverse research interests related to medical imaging, image processing, predictive technologies, and crime analysis. Wernick's research focuses on applications of machine learning and image processing in the fields of medical imaging and crime analysis, and he has been involved in the hardware and software development of several novel imaging systems, including new forms of phase-sensitive x-ray (DEI/MIR) imaging and multispectral imaging of the eye. In the field of medical imaging, Wernick and his Illinois Tech colleagues have developed methods of performing automated image processing, reconstruction and/or analysis for imaging of the breast, heart, brain, prostate, and joints. He and his colleagues have developed new 4D image reconstruction algorithms that promise to dramatically reduce radiation dose in SPECT imaging. Wernick is currently serving as technical lead on a research program in "predictive policing" in collaboration with the Chicago Police Department, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). In this program, machine learning, social network analysis, and methods drawn from image processing are being applied to produce forward-looking analysis of crime data to promote data-driven policing. Wernick has co-founded two companies, Predictek, Inc., and ADM Diagnostics, LLC which provide image analysis services to the pharmaceutical industry, and which have developed automated systems for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and other dementias from brain scans. Wernick was co-editor of the book, Emission Tomography : The Fundamentals of PET and SPECT . He was guest editor of a special issue on medical imaging IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, and has served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing , SPIE/IS&T Journal of Electronic Imaging , and Medical Physics .

Jialing Xiang | Jialing Xiang Professor of Biology Chair of Biology Graduate Affairs Committee Tags: Faculty Biology Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Jialing Xiang Education M.D. Xuzhou Medical University Ph.D. University of Alabama at Birmingham Research Interests The work in my laboratory is focused on answering the basic biological questions at the molecular level related to human diseases. The research areas include program cell death, signaling transduction, and cellular protein membrane trafficking. One of the major projects involves proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bad. We identified a unique Bax isoform, which may serve as a prognostic marker for cancer chemotherapy. We also defined a broad signaling interplay between apoptotic pathway and other signaling pathways, involving many pathological events, such as hormone refractory and inflammation. We believe that study of the cellular signaling process will help our understanding of the molecular basis of human diseases and identify cellular targets for the effective treatment.

Qing-Chang Zhong | Qing-Chang Zhong Max McGraw Endowed Chair Professor of Energy and Power Engineering and Management Tags: Faculty Electrical and Computer Engineering Armour College of Engineering Home Office and Department Directory Directory Qing-Chang Zhong Education Ph.D. in Control and Power Engineering, Imperial College London, UK, 2004 Ph.D. in Control Theory and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University, China, 2000 M.Sc in Control Theory and Engineering, Hunan University, China, 1997 Diploma in Electrical Engineering, Xiangtan Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Technologies (now Hunan Institute of Engineering), China, 1990 Research Interests Qing-Chang Zhong, an IEEE Fellow and an IET Fellow, holds the Max McGraw Endowed Chair Professor in Energy and Power Engineering and Management at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA. He was educated at Imperial College London (Ph.D., 2004, awarded the Best Doctoral Thesis Prize), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Ph.D., 2000), Hunan University (MSc, 1997), and Hunan Institute of Engineering (Diploma, 1990). Zhong is well recognized worldwide as one of very few leading experts in control, power electronics and power systems, being appointed as a Distinguished Lecturer of three IEEE Societies (Control Systems/Power Electronics/Power and Energy), and an Associate Editor of seven flagship journals in control and power electronics, including IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control , IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology , IEEE Trans. on Power Electronics and IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics . He is also truly globalized, having previously held positions in the UK, Israel and China. Before joining Illinois Institute of Technology, he was the Chair Professor in Control and Systems Engineering at The University of Sheffield, UK, where he built up a $5M+ research lab dedicated to the control of energy and power systems and attracted the support of Rolls-Royce, National Instruments, Texas Instruments, Siemens, ALSTOM, Turbo Power Systems, Chroma, Yokogawa, OPAL RT etc. Zhong is a dedicated educator. Two of his four graduated Chinese Ph.D. students received the National Award for Outstanding Chinese Students Abroad including one Grand Prize (only 10 such awards worldwide each year and only two UK students have received the Grand Prize so far). Ten of his researchers have secured faculty positions. Zhong’s current research focuses on advanced control theory, power electronics and the seamless integration of both to address fundamental challenges in various energy and power systems. In 2016 alone, he had 30 journal papers accepted/published, including 20 papers in IEEE Transactions. In total, he has published 200+ papers. He (co-)authored three research monographs, including Control of Power Inverters in Renewable Energy and Smart Grid Integration (Wiley-IEEE Press, 2013) and Robust Control of Time-delay Systems (Springer, 2006). He solved a series of fundamental theoretical problems about robust control of time-delay systems. He is the lead inventor of virtual synchronous machines (synchronverters) and proposed the architecture, together with two technical routes, for next-generation smart grids based on the synchronization mechanism of synchronous machines. This unifies the interface of all different players --- such as wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles, energy storage systems and the majority of loads --- with the grid so that they can play the same role as conventional power plants to maintain system stability, enhance system resiliency, and reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. He served as a Senior Research Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering/Leverhulme Trust, UK, the UK Representative to the European Control Association, a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of US NSF FREEDM Systems Center at North Carolina State University and the Rolls-Royce UTP Board in Power Electronics Systems. He also served as grant reviewer for funding bodies from the UK, China, Singapore, Finland, Kuwait, Italy, Netherlands, Israel, and other countries.

Benjamin Zion | Benjamin Zion Associate Teaching Professor Tags: Faculty Chemistry Lewis College of Science and Letters Home Office and Department Directory Directory Benjamin Zion Education B.A. Lawrence University Ph.D. University of Chicago Research Interests Doctoral studies at the University of Chicago focused on reactions at surfaces, specifically oxidation and reactions on oxide surfaces. The principle technique employed was high resolution electron energy loss spectrometry (HREELS) to monitor in-situ development of surface vibrational features as qualitative and quantitative measures of reaction. Post graduate studies at Penn State University also focused on surface interactions. Second neutral emissions were conducted to monitor surface ablation products from primary ion impact. These studies were designed to bridge the gap in understanding between molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and time-of-flight, secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). MD gives results that cannot distinguish between ionic and neutral species whereas TOF-SIMS can only monitor ablated ionic species. Between academic research postings, I worked for two years in industrial product development at EInk Corp. in Cambridge, MA. I developed waveforms for driving the novel display technology of micro-encapsulated nanoparticles for grayscale rendering. This technology and these waveforms can be seen in products like Amazon's black-and-white Kindle eReader.
